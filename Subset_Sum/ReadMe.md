**The subset sum problem (SSP) is a decision problem in computer science. In its most general formulation, there is a multiset S of integers and a target-sum  T, and the question is to decide whether any subset of the integers sum to precisely T. The problem is known to be NP-complete. Moreover, some restricted variants of it are NP-complete too, for example:**

 * The variant in which all inputs are positive.
 * The variant in which inputs may be positive or negative, and T = 0 . For example, given the set { − 7 , − 3 , − 2 , 9000 , 5 , 8 } , the answer is yes because the subset { − 3 , − 2 , 5 }  sums to zero.
